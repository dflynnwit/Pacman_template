# Practical 4 - Pacman
We will again follow the Napier Course.
* Note that you will have to reuse math.h, levelsystem and pieces of code from the previous practicals to fill-in the missing pieces.
* As usual please commit and push as you work on this. It is a bit longer than the previous assignments.
* When you compile and find all compiler errors are gone, you will likely be left with linker errors, these errors occur as the compiler is looking for an implementation of a method that wasn't given - e.g. methods left out for you to fill in, or ones that you plain forgot to do.
* Note that the location of the level file may be changed to: ```ls::loadLevelFile("../pacman.txt", 25.0f);```
  or ```ls::loadLevelFile("../src/pacman.txt", 25.0f);```
  or ```ls::loadLevelFile("../res/pacman.txt", 25.0f);``` etc.
